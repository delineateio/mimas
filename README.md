## Purpose

Delineate is a platform for taking business ideas to end users without losing clarity of the orginal idea.  This repo contains the lightweight framework available as a package for building microservices in `go`.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to reduce the amount of code and complexity required to delivered services.

After reviewing other frameworks they still involved alout of boiler code (e.g. `go-kit`, `micro`, `gizmo`) and whilst they offer great functionality they were over complicated for the [delineate.io](https://www.delineate.io) platform requirements.

## Local Development

To set up a local development environment run `bash ./setup.sh`.

As part of this setup [pre-commit](https://www.pre-commit) a `git` hook is installed that depends on [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).  `golangci-lint` needs to be installed seperately and the official documentation should be consulted.
