## Our Security Policy

The delineate.io team and community take all security bugs in the delineate.io platform seriously.

> Our security policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.

 Thank you for improving the security of delineate.io. We appreciate your efforts to disclose the issue responsibly, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainers at security@delineate.io.

## What We Will Do

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within a week (7 days), and will send a more detailed response up to 48 hours after that indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and an announcement. We may ask for additional information or guidance.

The delineate.io team will:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
* Audit code to find any similar problems
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible
